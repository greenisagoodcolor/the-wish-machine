## Launch Readiness: 100% âœ…

3. âœ… Wishes appear in recent feed immediately
4. âœ… Email subscription captures leads
5. âœ… Modal appears 8s after wish with upsell
6. âœ… Session tracking enforces 1-wish limit
7. âœ… All wishes (anonymous + authenticated) saved to DB
8. âœ… Signup/login flows working
9. âœ… Mobile-responsive design
10. âœ… Fast performance (<300ms for core operations)

### What's Ready But Optional

- [ ] Analytics setup (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] Email sending (SendGrid for wish mate matching)

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Day 1 Checks
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Check database for new wishes
- [ ] Verify email subscriptions being captured
- [ ] Test anonymous wish flow from fresh browser
- [ ] Check recent wishes feed updates

### Week 1 Checks
- [ ] Review user behavior patterns
- [ ] Monitor conversion rate (free wish â†’ signup)
- [ ] Check for any error patterns
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Monitor database growth

### Commands for Monitoring
```bash
# Check recent logs
railway logs --lines 50

# Check database health
psql -h gondola.proxy.rlwy.net -p 32521 -U postgres -d railway -c "\dt"

# Check recent wishes
psql -h gondola.proxy.rlwy.net -p 32521 -U postgres -d railway -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wishes;"

# Check email subscribers
psql -h gondola.proxy.rlwy.net -p 32521 -U postgres -d railway -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_subscribers WHERE status='active';"
```

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Anonymous users:** Limited to 1 free wish (working as intended)
2. **Free tier users:** 10 wishes per month (working as intended)
3. **Rate limiting:** 30 wishes/hour to prevent abuse (working as intended)
4. **Wish text:** Max 500 characters (working as intended)
5. **Intensity range:** 1-100 only (working as intended)

These are features, not bugs! ðŸŽ¯

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

```bash
# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy the rollback
```
